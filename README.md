## Ethics
* First and foremost, one of the ethical principles that we abide by is sustainability. With our manual, we strive to be extremely eco-friendly through the act of recycling, and we do so along with valuing efficiency. Second, we believe in having respect for every user of our manual, no matter their background, as we talk about in our Inclusivity Statement. Lastly, we believe in the right to confidentiality. Users deserve to keep whatever information they please private.

## Inclusivity
* Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is one of the top priorities for us. We believe that everyone, no matter their age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or potential disability, deserves accessibility to our manual and should be supported when using our it. Our values include empathy, open-mindedness, and acceptance. We embrace making our manual equitable for all underrepresented groups who use it, especially those that face challenges surrounding manuals like ours.
