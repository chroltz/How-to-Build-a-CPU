## About the Project


Provided here is a manual for replacing and recycling a CPU, and all the steps that may come in-between.
 
This project seeks to provide resources to help users replace and recycle their CPU. Not only for better computer function but to reduce E-waste as well.
 
On launch the landing page has an introduction and general information. To the left there is a sidebar to navigate through the pages. The pages contain various information from buying parts to recycling resources.
 
Here in GitHub, there are other documents such as a license and diversity statement.
 
We hope you enjoy it!
