<!--Looks like you're ready to get making with Pitt Fuego Webtext Generator. Good luck. Let's remember a few basic things:

1. If you haven't worked through one of our Pitt Fuego introductory tools (Electrate Fuego or I Am...A Project in Becoming), please do so. These programs will give you the basic skills to use this webtext generator.
2. Add content from code repository at the bottom of this file. Copy and paste from <div> to </div>.
3. Pay attention to file management - keep your asset names simple or use camel case.
4. Make sure your code matches your asset/file type. Code is case sensitive,
5. Describe all images and clearly label links and buttons for accessibility  purposes.
6. Consult w3.org when your code needs to do more than it does.
7. Control Z, Control Z, Control Z...
8. Publish, share, spread the Fuego!-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

  <div style="text-align: left">
    <p>The reason for wanting to upgrade a CPU or processor varies for everyone. Asking yourself questions as well as doing research will help you determine whether upgrading your cpu provides benefits. <br><br> If you are unfamiliar with any terms used on this page, please refer to the <a href="7.html">General Defintions</a> page. </p>
  </div>

  <h2>What Functions Do You Use Your Computer For? </h2>
  <p> Consider what functions you use your computer for. Are you using CPU intensive applications such as editing, video, and gaming software, or are you using it for day-to-day functions? What are your power requirements for personal or work use? You must consider why exactly you want to upgrade your CPU and whether the cost of a new CPU is worth the performance gain. </p>
  <h2>How Long Have You Have Your Computer? </h2>
  <p>If your CPU is relatively new, it should be fine for the most part and wouldn't need to be upgraded. But if your CPU is 5-10+ years old there could be benefits to upgrading it, but this depends if the performance affects the functionality of the computer.</p>
  <h2> How Is Your CPU Performance? </h2>
  <p> Slow performance could be caused by other issues like old thermal paste, a loose or broken CPU cooler, or outdated BIOS settings. Additionally, there are practical reasons for upgrading a computer with sufficient performance. If you are unsure about the performance, and whether your CPU causes the poor performance, it will be helpful to identify this using these steps: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>On Windows 10, click the Start button, then type “about” into the search field. Click on About your PC and the following Window shows up: </li>
    <img src="windows.png" alt="view of windows " style="width:45%;" class="center-img">
    <p style="text-align: center"><em>View of Windows "About" settings.</em></p>
    <li>Run CPU Benchmark such as <a href="https://www.cgdirector.com/cinebench-r23-scores-updated-results/">Cinebench R23</a> to compare your CPU’s scores to online database</li>
  </ol>
  <p> If score matches with what others reported your CPU performs to its specifications and your performance problems could be caused by something else </p>
  <h2> Is Your CPU Bottlenecking and Limiting Your CPU Performance? </h2>
  <p> To check for a bottleneck, you want to run applications and games that you use regularly. To check your CPU’s utilization, you can use Windows Task Manager to monitor your CPU’s utilization: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl- Shift + Esc</b> to open Task Manager, navigate to the ‘Performance’ tab, then select CPU. You should see a graph showing your CPU’s utilization percentage. </li>
    <li>Right-click the graph, hover over ‘change graph to’, and select ‘logical processors’. This should show the utilization of all your CPU’s cores and threads.</li>
    <li>It should be clear if the CPU bottlenecks the rest of the system.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The left hand side of Task Manager’s Performance shows CPU utilization. If CPU utilization is maxing out most of its core, showing a percentage close to 100%, then you would likely benefit from having a CPU with more cores. </p>
